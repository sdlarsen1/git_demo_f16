We are learning git commands today.

We learned about 'git branch', it is used to make copiesof our code that we can edit distinctly from other parts of the project
example usage:
git branch <my_new_branch>
git checkout <my_new_branch>
git cheack -a   # to check that we are on the correct branch!

Another command we learned about was 'git add', it is used to add a file to our project such that we can share it with our friends.
example usage:
git add my_new_file.txt
git status   # to list the new files or changes that have been added to your project
git diff    # will show what changes you have made
